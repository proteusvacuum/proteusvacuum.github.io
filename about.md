My name is Farid. Sometimes I write on this blog.

I have a strong belief that technology can have a positive impact on society, and I am particularly concerned with using technology in a socially just, civic manner.

I currently spend my days as a software developer at [Provender](http://provender.com), where we are creating an online platform to remake the path from the farmer's field to professional kitchens. Before that I was working on bikes and reading books.

I currently live in Montreal, Canada.
